        Tired of remembering which character you stored that one gun you've been waiting to try out? Not sure
        if that gun you farmed is better than the other variant you know you have lying around? Borderlands 3
        Gear Tracker will make sure you never forget where you left your gear and make it easy to check what
        gear you already have while you are out farming for new loot!
